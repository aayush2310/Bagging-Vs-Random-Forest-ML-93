RF is internally an implementation of Bagging.

1)In bagging we can use different base models but in random forest we use only decision trees.
  SYNTAX:-In bagging syntax,we have a parameter to select the base estimator but in the random forest we dont have any such parameter.
  
2)Lets us suppose we take the bagging syntax and initialize each base model as decision tree,then also it is not a random forest.The difference comes in feature selection
  or feature sampling also called column sampling.
  (IMP)**
  In bagging lets suppose we take decision trees as base model and we do column sampling in which initially we had 5 columns and we selected 2 columns then in bagging the 
  first decision tree was sampled and got column 1,3 then that whole decision tree would be made on the basis of column 1,3
  But in random forest lets us suppose the first decision tree was given a sampled column as 1,3 then 1,3 will be used for the first level classification then in the next 
  level sampling will be done and lets say we got 2,5 then those two columns will be used in that level and so on.
  So,more randomness is introduced in case of Random Forest as column sampling is done at each level.
